        When Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur named Beyond Career one of the most impactful startups, it meant a lot. Because this isn’t just a startup — it’s a response to a broken system where opportunities are hidden, support is limited, and real talent is often overlooked.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fade-slide">
        We built Beyond Career for students who never got a callback. For those with potential but no access. For the ones who believed in themselves, but just needed someone else to believe in them too.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fade-slide">
        This win isn’t ours alone. It belongs to everyone who showed up, trusted the process, and said, “I’m in — let’s build something better.”
      </p>
      <p class="lead fade-slide">
        And to those still figuring it out — we’re just getting started.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fade-slide">
        None of this would have been possible without Nitish Kumar — the quiet strength behind the scenes who helped build it all.
