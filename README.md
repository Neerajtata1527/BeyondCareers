## ðŸ§  Design Rationale (50 words)

- **Why you chose the overall layout and structure**
- Well i chose this layout and styling personally inorder to match the company logo theme .
- And also made sure to be as consistent as i can with the colours to avoid over themed or over animated.
  
- **Color scheme & typography**:
- The visual choice is almost focused on the Skyblue and pale lemon yellow colour in order to match the brand theme.
- And also it is simple yet gives us professional vibes.

## ðŸ’» Technical Documentation 

- **Technologies Used**:
- 
- **Python**The key tech Stack used in this project is Python(Flask) for providing backend for the website
- 
- **Bootstrap**:for styling i have used Bootstrap as a reference for designing several
- website entities starting from Hero's in home page to the Card tags .The usage of Bootstrap had made it easy to stylize the website further more since the Bootstrap also
- allows several prebuilt classes in order to stylize the elements well just by adding those classes..
- 
- **HTML,CSS,JS**: Along with Bootstrap i had also used the key elements like HTML,css for further personalized styling in order to match the BeyondCareers logo and motive..
- and the usage of JS had made the website look even more lively by adding hovering effects and stylizing the webpage even more upon the required conditions met..
- 
- **Challenges & Solutions**:there was a bunch of errors which are popped up in js console and upon launching the site.These errors had popped up due to some typo or misplacements
- and there after i had faced issues while launching my project it had crashed in my first attempt ,but after some keen observation i had resolved these with help of some chatgpt as well..
- 
- **Performance Optimization**:I had optimized the website to become mobile responsive as well by adding several key elements in boot strap classes like lg-6(which is more like it
- should display some content in 6 columns out of 12 columns in larger screens) etc. And i had deleted some repeatedly used code like some part from head tag and some part from body tag
- and i had placed it in seperate html files like header.html and footer.html and later on i had used jinja to include these in several html pages like about.html etc.
- This has significantly reduced code size and made the code kinda more readable..

## ðŸš€ Deployment Guide 

**Steps to Deploy**: 
- To deploy this website first i have created a fresh GitHub reprocity and  uploaded all my project files to GitHub
-  via git Bash command prompts which can easily upload all our project file from our project folder to  our  Created GitHub reprosity..
-  And later on i had used online free cloud based webservice hosting platfrom which is render.
-  
- **Platform Choice**: I chose render to host this project, Because it is free to use and Beginner friendly and it also supports my main.py file i.e(Flask) in order to provide
- Backend to this Project, where as other sites like vercel don't support python based files while hosting the website/web service.
- The only drawback for this is due to the delay like 1 min for opening the webpage upon clicking the link this is all because of the free version and also
- the website enters the cold stage upon not using it for longer time so it kinda enters sleep state and upon waking it up it'll stay active and and opens upon clicking
- for the next 15 minutes.

- **Final URL & Testing**:
